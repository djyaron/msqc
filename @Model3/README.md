Model3
======

For a given molecule and geometry, be able to produce the energies in a set of environments.

On construction, you pass it Frag's (possibly 3, for normal, diffuse and narrow).

The model is constructed by adding mixers, that convert the matrix elements in Frag into modified matrix elements.
